        <h4>Website Development</h4>
        <p>We can develop web sites for your Internet (World Wide Web) or
            intranet (private network). This can range from developing a single
            static page of plain text to a complex web-based internet application (web
            apps), e-commerce, or social network services. <br>
            <br>
            Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the user interfece aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web
            development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
            changes easier and available with basic technical skills.<br>
            <br>
            For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist
            of hundreds of people including architects, database administraotors and cloud engineers and follow standard methods like
            Agile methodologies or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
        </p>
        <p>
            Smaller organizations may
            only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
            assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
            information systems technician. <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Hardware Installation</h4>
        <p> Hardware will be installed,
            configured, and tested in your premises.<br><br>
            We can also upgrade a
            computer system memory, hard drives, video cards, sounds cards, rom
            drives (CD/DVD/Blue-Ray rom drives), power supplies, and motherboards as required.<br><br>
            We also install and configure routers, printers, servers and desktop images.
        </p>

        <h4>Hardware Configuration</h4>
        <p>Hardware configuration deals with the details and system resource
            settings allotted for a specific device. <br><br>
            Our computer specialists
            improve hardware performance by adjusting configurations, which may also
            include settings for the motherboard and the BIOS, as well as the bus
            speeds. <br><br>
            This saves you money by avoiding unnecessary hardware upgrades.

        </p>

        <h4>System Management<br></h4>
            <p>Enterprise-wide administration of distributed systems including computer systems, data storage systems and networking systems.
            <br><br>
            For a small business startup with ten computers, automated centralized
            processes may take more time to learn how to use and implement than just
            doing the management work manually on each computer.
            <br><br>
            A very large business with thousands of similar employee computers may
            clearly be able to save time and money, by having IT staff learn to do
            systems management automation.
            <br><br>
            A small branch office of a large corporation may have access to a central
            IT staff, with the experience to set up automated management of the
            systems in the branch office, without need for local staff in the branch
            office to do the work.
