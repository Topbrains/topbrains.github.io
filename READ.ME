Temporary Workaround to get this web site to work with GitHub Pages:
You can rename your repository to topbrains.github.io (the exact username match) and it will serve from root without the repo name.

Would you like me to help you check any of these specific configurations? If you share whether you're using plain HTML or a static site generator, I can give more specific advice.

The temporary workaround is good! Thanks!
You're welcome! The temporary workaround of renaming your repository to topbrains.github.io (exactly matching your GitHub username) will make GitHub Pages serve your site directly from:

https://topbrains.github.io/
instead of

https://topbrains.github.io/Web/
Steps to Rename Your Repo:
Go to your Web repository on GitHub.

Click "Settings" (top-right tab).

Under "Repository name", change Web to topbrains.github.io.

Click "Rename" (GitHub will handle all redirects automatically).

Important Notes:
All links must now be root-relative (e.g., /sections/Products.html instead of /Web/sections/Products.html).

If you had a custom domain, you may need to update DNS settings.

If you were using GitHub Pages with a /docs folder, ensure the source is set correctly in Settings â†’ Pages.

After Renaming:
GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically.

Your site should now load at https://topbrains.github.io/sections/Products.html without the missing /Web/.
